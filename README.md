## Challenges Faced

Creating CineBase wasn't without its challenges. One of the most significant hurdles I encountered was developing the API. The API not only handles text data but also image and video files, making it more complex. Implementing features like uploading image and video files was a time-consuming task, but I have successfully overcome these challenges to provide a comprehensive movie database.
